<h1 class= "The_toll">THE TOLL</h1>    
<p class="names">1. "The Peacock and the Turtle"</p>
  
  
<p class="text"><mark>Once upon a time</mark> in India, there was a <mark>peacock</mark>. He  lived near a river. A turtle lived in the river. The peacock and the turtle <mark>became</mark> good friends. 'You're such a lovely bird, said the turtle,'I love to look at your beautiful <mark>tail</mark>.' The turtle told the peacock interesting stories about the river. 'You're so clever, Turtle,' said the peacock.'I love to listen to you' .One day, a man <mark>caught</mark> the peacock.
'I'm going to sell you in the market', he said and he <mark>tied</mark> a rope around the peacock's legs and wings. Luckily the turtle saw this, and she said to the man: "Wait! I can get a <mark>pearl</mark> from the bottom of the river for you ; But you must let my friend go: 'All right,' said the man. He <mark>knew</mark> that a pearl was <mark>worth</mark> more than the peacock.The turtle swam to the bottom of the <mark>muddy</mark> river and soon came back with a large, white pearl. She gave it to the man and he <mark>untied</mark> the rope. After he left, the peacock said: "Thank you. Now we can be happy again. 'No.' said the turtle.'I don't trust that man'. You must fly to the jungle. It's safer there!
The peacock didn't want to leave his friend, but he knew that she was right. Sure enough, the next day the man came back. "I think the peacock was worth more than <ins>one</ins> pearl'he said to the turtle. 'Get me another pearl or I can easily catch your friend again.' The turtle knew that the peacock was safe in the jungle, but she wanted to teach the <mark>greedy</mark> man a lesson. 'Well,' she said.'There are lots of pearls in the river, but they're all different sizes and colours.' -'That isn't important' said the man.'Just get me another pearl' -'But two identical pearls are worth much more than two different ones' said the turtle. 'That's true' said the man. 'Well, get me a pearl <mark>exactly</mark> the same as this one!' -'That's difficult' said the turtle.'It's very muddy down there, and I can't easily remember the <mark>exact</mark> size and colour of your pearl.' -'Take this pearl with you' said the man. 'That's a brilliant idea' said the turtle. 'You're a very
clever man'. She took the pearl and <mark>disappeared</mark> into the muddy river. The man waited and waited, but he never saw the turtle,the peacock or his pearl again.</p>
